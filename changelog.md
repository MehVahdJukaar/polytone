- big internal changes:
- all polytone resources re now reloaded and unloaded on world load and unload
- this means they can now all use tags and generally work nicely with the rest of the game
- targeting can also use regex
- particles will have their age variable set to lifetime (max life) every time they die for whichever reason
- fixed custom creative tabs on neoforge (due to previous changes)
- block offsets from block modifiers will exclusively affect the position of the rendered block, not its hitbox to avoid issues on server due to mismatched hitbox
- this also means that it will likely not work anymore with sodium as it probably overrides any logic related to rendering
- fixed variant textures game_time using day_time instead
- with the recent changes polytone wont be able to alter anything outside of a world load, so no main menu stuff. RIP splash text colors for now
