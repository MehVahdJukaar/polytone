Polytone is a powerful client-side customization mod which allows tweaking various aspect with the game via Resource Packs

These include:

* Customize Map Colors 🗺️
* Customize Dye Colors 🖌️
* Change Block Sounds 🎵
* Custom Colormaps 🎨
* Block Offset Type 📐
* Customize Biome Effects 🌊

For some things the mod also offers backwards compatibility with the system previously offered by Optifine (color.properties file), allowing said features from existing packs to work aswell

The mod is designed to be fast and as light weight as possible while keeping the most customizaiton it can. 
Not only does it offer a replacement for color.properties system but also offer way, way more features and customization options that were previously not available.

The mod can work both in VANILLA and in MODDED environment, working flawlessly with ANY Biome, Particle, Blocks and so on, unlike what previous mods did.

The mod is meant to be used by anyone
